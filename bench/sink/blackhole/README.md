# blackhole-sink

A minimal OTLP receiver used as the benchmark target. It accepts spans
and log records over OTLP/gRPC and OTLP/HTTP, counts them with atomic
counters, and discards everything else, so latency and throughput
reflect the SDK under test and the network path with no collector work
mixed in. Metrics requests are accepted and counted as requests and
bytes, but their contents are not decoded.

## Ports

| Port | Protocol | Endpoint |
|------|----------|----------|
| 4317 | gRPC (plaintext) | OTLP TraceService.Export, LogsService.Export, MetricsService.Export |
| 4318 | HTTP/2 cleartext (h2c) | POST /v1/traces and /v1/logs (parsed), /v1/metrics (stubbed) |
| 19080 | HTTP/1.1 | GET /health, GET /stats, POST /reset |

## Control API

```
GET  /health   → 200 "ok"
GET  /stats    → 200 application/json (see Snapshot fields below)
POST /reset    → 200 "{}" (zeroes all counters; uptime is not reset)
```

### Snapshot fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `spans_received` | uint64 | Total span records counted |
| `log_records_received` | uint64 | Total log records counted (`/v1/logs` and `LogsService`) |
| `bytes_received` | uint64 | Wire bytes in (HTTP: body size; gRPC: proto.Size — see Compression) |
| `requests_received` | uint64 | HTTP + gRPC request total |
| `http_requests_received` | uint64 | HTTP-only request count |
| `grpc_requests_received` | uint64 | gRPC-only request count |
| `response_bytes` | uint64 | Total serialized response bytes sent |
| `errors` | uint64 | Requests rejected with an error |
| `last_error` | string | Description of most recent error, empty if none |
| `uptime_seconds` | float64 | Seconds since process start (not reset by /reset) |

## Compression

Both listeners inflate gzip before counting spans and log records, so the `*-gzip` SUTs report
real delivery:

| Path | Trigger | Inflated by |
|------|---------|-------------|
| HTTP | `content-encoding: gzip` | the trace and logs handlers, after `bytes_received` is taken |
| gRPC | `grpc-encoding: gzip` (message CF=`0x01`) | grpc-go, via the registered gzip compressor |

`bytes_received` means the same thing on both: the compressed size of what
arrived. grpc-go inflates before the handler runs, so the gRPC path cannot
measure the request inside the handler. Instead, `StatsHandlerOption()` installs a
`grpc.StatsHandler` that records `stats.InPayload.WireLength` per RPC and the
handler reads that instead of `proto.Size` ([#228](https://github.com/chanderraja/microtel/issues/228)).
`WireLength` includes the 5-byte gRPC length-prefix header, so uncompressed
gRPC byte baselines are 5 bytes per message higher than before that landed.

Any server registering these handlers must pass `StatsHandlerOption()`;
without it `bytes_received` silently falls back to the uncompressed
`proto.Size`.

## Response delay

Setting `SINK_RESPONSE_DELAY_MS` makes the trace and logs handlers (and
the gRPC metrics handler) sleep that many milliseconds before responding.
The stubbed HTTP metrics route is not delayed. The driver sets it from
`--sink-delay-ms` to push the batch span processor's queue toward
saturation in the backpressure profile.

## Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t blackhole-sink .
docker run --rm -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 -p 19080:19080 blackhole-sink
```

## Run locally

```bash
go run ./cmd/blackhole-sink
```

Requires Go 1.25+ (the `go` directive in `go.mod`).

## gRPC reflection

The gRPC server registers the standard server reflection service, so you can
inspect it with `grpcurl`:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:4317 list
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:4317 describe opentelemetry.proto.collector.trace.v1.TraceService
```
