# Crash-corpus regression gate. Replays every committed crashing input under
# tests/fuzz/crashes/<target>/ against its fuzz harness and fails if any of
# them still crashes.
#
# Fuzzing itself is a periodic job, not a PR gate — it is slow and its findings
# are non-deterministic (tests/fuzz/README.md). This script is the part that
# *is* a hard gate: once a crash is found and fixed, its input stays committed
# so the same bug cannot come back silently. Replay is deterministic and takes
# well under a second per input, so it is cheap enough to run on every PR.
#
# libFuzzer runs one input per invocation when given a file rather than a
# directory, and exits non-zero if the harness crashes, asserts, or trips a
# sanitizer. That exit status is the whole test.
#
# Usage:  ci/scripts/corpus-check.sh [build-dir]     (default: build-fuzz)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every committed crash input replayed cleanly (or none are committed)
#   1  at least one input still crashes — a regression
#   2  the gate could not run (no build dir, harness binary missing)
