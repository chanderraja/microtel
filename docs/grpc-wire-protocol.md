# gRPC Wire Protocol on nghttp2 — Implementation Notes

**Status:** M0 deliverable. Implementation notes for the OTLP/gRPC codec under `src/wire/grpc/`. Companion to `interfaces.md` (the `IWireCodec` contract) and `error-model.md` §7.2 (the gRPC retry classification matrix).
**Source of truth for rationale:** `microtel-spec.md` §7.2.
**Audience:** the contributor or AI agent picking up Track C (OTLP/gRPC wire) at M3 onward.

This document goes deeper than spec §7.2. It pins the exact codec state machine, byte-level edge cases, the `RetryInfo` decode path, and the malformed-server failure modes that production gRPC traffic actually exhibits.

---

## 1. Goals and non-goals

### 1.1 Goals

Implement the **gRPC wire protocol** sufficient for OTLP unary RPCs, on top of nghttp2 — without linking the gRPC library or any of its transitive dependencies.

The supported endpoint is exactly:

```
POST /opentelemetry.proto.collector.trace.v1.TraceService/Export
```

Plus, in v1.2+, the metrics and logs analogues (same shape).

### 1.2 Explicit non-goals

Per spec §7.2:

- **Server-streaming, client-streaming, bidi-streaming RPCs.** OTLP is unary-only. The codec rejects any response that delivers more than one DATA-frame message before END_STREAM as malformed.
- **Service config / retry policy JSON.** Retry policy is microtel's, not negotiated.
- **Name resolution / xDS / load balancing.** One endpoint per `ITransport`.
- **Health checking service. Server reflection. Channel-state machinery beyond "open or reconnecting."**
- **Interceptors / middleware.** Auth is handled by `IAuthProvider`; nothing else interposes.
- **Compression negotiation beyond `gzip`.** No `deflate`, no `snappy` in v1.

These are not arrangements; they are constraints on the codec implementation. Any code that assumes one of these features should fail review.

---

## 2. Wire shape

### 2.1 Request HEADERS frame

Sent on stream open. Required pseudo-headers and headers:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `:method` | `POST` |
| `:scheme` | `https` (or `http` if `insecure=true`) |
| `:authority` | endpoint authority (host:port) |
| `:path` | `/opentelemetry.proto.collector.trace.v1.TraceService/Export` |
| `te` | `trailers` |
| `content-type` | `application/grpc+proto` |
| `user-agent` | `microtel-cpp/<version>` (or `microtel-python/<version>`) |
| `grpc-encoding` | `gzip` if request compression on; absent otherwise |
| `grpc-accept-encoding` | `gzip` if response decompression supported; `identity` otherwise |
| `grpc-timeout` | absent in v1 — microtel manages its own timeouts and uses `RST_STREAM` on local timeout (see §2.5) |

Plus any user-configured static headers (`exporter.headers` in `microtel.toml`) and the `Authorization` header from `IAuthProvider`.

**Header rules.** Header values are HPACK-encoded by nghttp2; microtel constructs them as `std::string_view` plus copy where nghttp2 needs an owning view. No header is rejected at the codec layer — validation is HPACK's responsibility — but oversized headers are caught by HTTP/2's own limits (`SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE`).

`:authority` is built from the configured endpoint, **not** from the user's `host` header if any. A user-supplied `host` is rejected at config-load time per spec §12.

### 2.2 Request DATA frames — gRPC framing

Per gRPC spec, each gRPC message is prefixed with a 5-byte header:

```
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|  CF    |       message length (BE)         |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| message bytes (length bytes)               |
+--------------------------------------------+
```

- `CF` — compression flag. `0x00` means uncompressed; `0x01` means compressed per `grpc-encoding`. Other values are illegal in v1 (`0x02..0xFF` reserved per gRPC spec).
- `length` — big-endian uint32, **excludes** the 5-byte prefix.

**Unary OTLP requests carry exactly one message.** The codec writes the 5-byte prefix followed by the encoded protobuf bytes from `EncodedPayload` (`memory-model.md` §3.2).

Compression: if `grpc-encoding: gzip` is set, the protobuf bytes are gzip-compressed *before* the 5-byte prefix is computed. The compression flag is `0x01` and the length is the compressed length. (LOCKED)

DATA frames are sent with `END_STREAM=1` on the final frame so the server sees a complete message followed by an empty trailers section after the response.

### 2.3 Response DATA frames — parsing

The codec receives an arbitrary stream of DATA bytes from nghttp2. **The parser must not assume a gRPC message corresponds to a single HTTP/2 DATA frame.** (LOCKED — spec §7.2)

Three concrete cases the parser handles:

1. **Whole message in one frame.** Common case. The 5-byte prefix and the message bytes arrive together.
2. **Message split across frames.** The prefix may arrive in one frame, the body in the next; the body itself may be split. Parser maintains a small ring of unconsumed bytes between callbacks.
3. **Multiple messages in one frame.** The codec rejects this for OTLP unary as malformed (§3.5 below). The parser still tracks length-prefixed boundaries to detect it cleanly.

The parser is a small state machine over four states:

```
WAIT_PREFIX -> READ_PREFIX(0..5) -> READ_BODY(0..length) -> COMPLETE
                       ^                                       |
                       |-----[next message — REJECT]------------
```

Bytes beyond `COMPLETE` cause `malformed_response`. Receiving `END_STREAM` in `WAIT_PREFIX` (i.e., DATA-empty) leads to either trailer-only handling (§2.4) if the response was indeed empty, or `malformed_response` otherwise.

### 2.4 Trailer HEADERS frame — status

After the (sole) DATA frame's `END_STREAM=1` signal — or as a trailer-only response — the server sends a HEADERS frame with the gRPC status:

| Trailer | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `grpc-status` | decimal status code, `"0"` = OK |
| `grpc-message` | optional URL-encoded human-readable message |
| `grpc-status-details-bin` | optional base64-encoded `google.rpc.Status` protobuf (used for `RetryInfo`) |

The codec inspects `grpc-status` first. If `"0"`, the response is success — proceed to parse the OTLP message body for partial-success. If non-zero, the response is failure — classify per `error-model.md` §7.2.

#### `grpc-status-details-bin` decoding

Specifically for `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED (8)`, the codec attempts to decode `grpc-status-details-bin`:

1. Base64-decode the value (URL-safe, no padding required per gRPC spec).
2. Parse as `google.rpc.Status` via upb.
3. Iterate `details[]`. Each entry is `google.protobuf.Any`; the codec inspects `type_url` and decodes `RetryInfo` (`type_url == "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.RetryInfo"`) explicitly.
4. If `RetryInfo` is present and has `retry_delay`, the codec returns `retryable=true, retry_after=<delay>`.
5. If `RetryInfo` is absent, the codec returns `retryable=false`. (LOCKED — spec §7.2)
6. Other `Any` types are not interpreted in v1; their presence is logged at `debug` for diagnostics.

`google.rpc.Status` and `RetryInfo` are vendored under `proto/` and generated under `gen/` alongside the OTLP protos. Updating the vendored `googleapis` set is an ICP.

### 2.5 Trailer-only responses

A **trailer-only** response is one where the server sends final status in the *initial* HEADERS frame, with `END_STREAM=1` and no DATA frames. Common in proxy-heavy environments where intermediaries terminate the stream early.

The codec recognises trailer-only by:

1. The first HEADERS frame has `END_STREAM=1`.
2. The frame contains `grpc-status` (and optionally `grpc-message`, `grpc-status-details-bin`).

When detected, the codec processes the headers as a trailer (§2.4) and skips the DATA-parsing path entirely.

If the first HEADERS frame has `END_STREAM=1` but **lacks** `grpc-status`, see §3.6 below — the codec falls back to HTTP-status-based classification.

### 2.6 Cancellation — `RST_STREAM`

The codec sends `RST_STREAM` with `error_code = CANCEL (0x8)` on:

- **Per-export timeout elapsed.** The exporter's per-export deadline fires before the stream completes.
- **Shutdown observed.** The exporter is in `Draining` and the stream cannot complete within the remaining budget.

`RST_STREAM` is the I/O thread's responsibility — the exporter signals a per-request cancel; the I/O thread submits the frame to nghttp2.

The cancelled stream's request record is completed with `Error::Kind::Cancelled` and the appropriate counter (`shutdown_timeout` or none if the request was simply timing-out under a retry budget that's also expiring).

## 3. Codec state machine

States and transitions for one in-flight request:

```
                 +---------------+
                 |   IDLE        |
                 +-------+-------+
                         | Send(payload)
                         v
                 +---------------+
                 |   SUBMITTED   |  (request enqueued to ITransport)
                 +-------+-------+
                         | I/O thread opens stream
                         v
                 +---------------+
                 |   STREAMING   |  (HEADERS sent; DATA in flight)
                 +-------+-------+
                         | END_STREAM ack on send
                         v
                 +---------------+
       +---------+   AWAIT_RESP  +-----+
       |         +-------+-------+     | trailer-only HEADERS
       |                 |             |
       | DATA arrives    | first       v
       |                 | HEADERS    +---------------+
       v                 v            |  STATUS_ONLY  |
+---------------+ +---------------+   +-------+-------+
| READ_BODY     | | READ_INITIAL  |           |
+-------+-------+ +-------+-------+           |
        | END_STREAM      |                   |
        v                 v                   v
+---------------+ +---------------+    +---------------+
|  AWAIT_TRAIL  | |  READ_BODY    |    |   COMPLETE    |
+-------+-------+ +---------------+    +-------+-------+
        | trailer HEADERS                       |
        v                                       |
+---------------+                               |
|  COMPLETE     |<-------------------------------+
+---------------+
```

**Timeouts** can fire in any state and transition to `CANCELLED` → `COMPLETE` with an error. `RST_STREAM` from the peer transitions any state to `COMPLETE` with `Error::Kind::Network` or `::Cancelled` depending on the peer error code.

**Memory cleanup.** On `COMPLETE`, the response buffer is reset, the in-flight request record is freed, the per-stream parser state is destroyed.

**Implementation note (non-normative) — distinguishing initial-vs-trailing HEADERS in the nghttp2 callback model.** nghttp2 surfaces every received header through a single `on_header_callback`. To bucket headers correctly into the state machine above (initial HEADERS feed `READ_INITIAL` / `STATUS_ONLY`; trailing HEADERS feed `AWAIT_TRAIL`), the codec inspects `frame->headers.cat`:

| `frame->headers.cat` | Meaning on a client stream |
|---|---|
| `NGHTTP2_HCAT_RESPONSE` | First HEADERS frame on this stream — the initial response headers. If `END_STREAM=1` and `grpc-status` is present, this is a trailer-only response. |
| `NGHTTP2_HCAT_HEADERS`  | Any subsequent HEADERS frame — for OTLP unary, these are trailers. |

The trailer-only recognition rule from §2.5 (END_STREAM on the first HEADERS combined with `grpc-status` present) is unchanged; `headers.cat` is the nghttp2-specific way to spot "this is the first HEADERS frame on a client stream." Validated against the OpenTelemetry Collector during the M1 spike.

---

## 4. Status interpretation

Pinned in `error-model.md` §7.2 (the matrix). This document does not duplicate the table; the rules below cover the specifics that affect implementation.

### 4.1 Status priority

When both an HTTP `:status` and `grpc-status` are present, the codec uses `grpc-status` for retry classification. (LOCKED — gRPC spec §3.) The HTTP `:status` is captured for diagnostics only.

### 4.2 Missing `grpc-status` (malformed servers / proxies)

When the response — including a trailer-only — lacks `grpc-status`, the codec falls back to the HTTP `:status`:

- `429`, `502`, `503`, `504` → retryable with jittered backoff.
- Anything else → `malformed_response` and the batch is dropped non-retryably.

This case is common in proxy-heavy environments. The codec emits a `warn`-level diagnostic on the first occurrence per `(connection)` so operators can see "your proxy is terminating gRPC streams without trailers."

### 4.3 Conflicting / impossible combinations

| Observed | Treatment |
|---|---|
| HTTP `:status` 200, `grpc-status` non-zero | Failure per `grpc-status` (LOCKED). |
| HTTP `:status` 4xx/5xx, `grpc-status` 0 | Treat as success per `grpc-status`. Diagnostic emitted because this configuration is unusual. |
| Multiple DATA messages before `END_STREAM` | `malformed_response`. |
| `END_STREAM=1` with no trailer HEADERS frame and no initial-with-status | `malformed_response`. |
| `grpc-status` in DATA payload (not in trailers) | `malformed_response`. |

### 4.4 `grpc-message` handling

`grpc-message` is URL-encoded UTF-8. The codec percent-decodes (no DOS protection needed — it's bounded by `max_trailer_bytes`) and stores the decoded message in `WireResult::error.message`, capped per the `BoundedString` rule in `interfaces.md` §3.

### 4.5 `RetryInfo` precedence

If both `grpc-message` and `grpc-status-details-bin` carry information about retry timing, `RetryInfo.retry_delay` wins over any inline `grpc-message` content. The latter is human-readable; the former is machine-readable; the codec acts on the machine-readable signal.

---

## 5. Compression

### 5.1 Request compression

Configured by `[exporter] compression = "gzip"`. Default off (low-CPU profile, per spec §7.1).

When on:

1. The codec wraps `EncodedPayload.bytes()` in a gzip stream.
2. The 5-byte prefix is computed from the **compressed** length, with `CF = 0x01`.
3. `grpc-encoding: gzip` is set in the request HEADERS.

The compression buffer is bounded by `max_record_bytes` upstream (the input is itself bounded), so the compressed output is bounded by a small overhead factor. Decompression-bomb protection on the response side is `max_decompressed_bytes`.

### 5.2 Response compression

Advertised via `grpc-accept-encoding: gzip`. If the server returns `grpc-encoding: gzip`, each DATA-frame message carries `CF = 0x01` and the codec decompresses before parsing. Decompression is bounded by `max_decompressed_bytes`; on overflow, the codec returns `decompression_too_large` per the matrix.

Mixed messages (some compressed, some not) are permitted by gRPC but unused for OTLP unary; the codec handles the per-message flag correctly anyway.

### 5.3 Distinct from HTTP `Content-Encoding`

`grpc-encoding` is per-message and lives at the gRPC layer. HTTP `Content-Encoding` is per-stream and would be applied by HTTP/2 transport layer. **microtel never sets HTTP `Content-Encoding` for gRPC requests** (LOCKED — gRPC compression is gRPC-layer).

---

## 6. HTTP/2 settings interactions

### 6.1 Settings exchanged at connect

microtel sends:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` | 100 (default; configurable) |
| `SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE` | 1 MiB (default; configurable) |
| `SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE` | nghttp2 default |
| `SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH` | 0 (we are a client; push not supported) |
| `SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` | nghttp2 default |
| `SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE` | 64 KiB (matches `max_trailer_bytes`) |

Server settings are honoured directly by nghttp2; the codec does not need to enforce them.

### 6.2 GOAWAY mid-batch

When the server sends `GOAWAY`:

1. Streams with IDs ≤ `last-stream-id` (the GOAWAY-permitted last) continue to completion.
2. Streams with IDs > `last-stream-id` are cancelled by nghttp2 with `REFUSED_STREAM`.
3. The codec receives a stream-level error for cancelled streams; the request record is completed with `retryable=true` and a small jittered backoff.
4. The transport observes the GOAWAY and triggers reconnect (driven by the reactor; new socket, new session).

The full sequence is `docs/sequences/goaway-handling.md`.

### 6.3 Flow control

For OTLP unary, request payloads fit comfortably under typical `INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE`. If a payload exceeds the per-stream window, nghttp2 fragments DATA frames as needed and waits for `WINDOW_UPDATE`. The codec is unaware of this; it submits a single DATA frame and lets nghttp2 chunk.

The codec's per-export timeout covers the case where flow control stalls the request indefinitely.

---

## 7. Test surfaces

The codec is tested at three levels.

### 7.1 Unit tests — `tests/unit/wire/grpc/`

Each parser state, each status-classification entry in §4, each compression branch. Mocks `IAuthProvider`, `ITransport`. Uses `FakeTransport` to script byte-level responses.

### 7.2 Wire tests — `tests/grpc-wire/`

Byte-level validation against captured responses from real grpc-server and the OpenTelemetry Collector. Each test fixture is a single recorded HTTP/2 byte stream; the codec is run against it; the test asserts the resulting `WireResult` matches expected.

Required corpus entries (M9 hardening milestone):

- Trailer-only response with `grpc-status: 0`.
- Trailer-only response with `grpc-status: 14` (UNAVAILABLE).
- Trailer-only response without `grpc-status` (malformed).
- Multi-DATA-frame response with a single message split mid-prefix.
- Multi-DATA-frame response with a single message split mid-body.
- Response with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` and inline `RetryInfo` in `grpc-status-details-bin`.
- Response with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` and no `RetryInfo`.
- Response with `partial_success` in DATA and `grpc-status: 0` in trailers.
- Response with conflicting HTTP `:status: 503` and `grpc-status: 0`.
- GOAWAY mid-stream during DATA.
- RST_STREAM with `INTERNAL_ERROR (0x2)` from peer.

### 7.3 Conformance tests — `tests/conformance/`

End-to-end against a real OpenTelemetry Collector container. Validates the codec produces payloads accepted by upstream and parses their responses correctly. Run on every PR.

### 7.4 Fuzzing — `tests/fuzz/grpc_codec_fuzz.cpp`

libFuzzer harness over the response-parser entry point. Inputs: arbitrary byte sequences claiming to be HTTP/2 frames containing gRPC payloads. Goal: zero crashes, zero ASAN/UBSAN findings, bounded memory growth even on adversarial inputs.

Required for v1.0 release per spec §13.5.

---

## 8. Cross-references to OTLP/HTTP

The HTTP and gRPC codecs share:

- `IOtlpEncoder` output (the encoded protobuf bytes). Identical.
- The `IWireCodec` interface contract (`interfaces.md` §4.3).
- The retry-budget and jittered-backoff logic, which lives in the exporter, not the codecs.
- `IAuthProvider`, `IDiagnosticsSink`, `ITransport`.

They differ in:

- Path, headers, framing.
- Retry classification (the matrices in `error-model.md` §7.1 vs §7.2).
- Compression layer (`Content-Encoding` for HTTP vs `grpc-encoding` for gRPC).
- Status source (HTTP `:status` for the HTTP codec, `grpc-status` trailer for the gRPC codec, with `:status` fallback when missing).

A single test plan exercises the shared contract; the protocol-specific tests cover the wire-shape divergence.

---

## 9. Known interop hazards

Real-world gRPC traffic encounters proxies, service meshes, and load balancers that don't always implement the gRPC trailer correctly. Five hazards we know about, with mitigation.

| Hazard | Cause | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Trailer-only responses without `grpc-status` | nginx/envoy aborting upstream connection | §4.2 fallback to HTTP `:status`; `warn` diagnostic on first occurrence |
| `Connection: close` on HTTP/2 | non-compliant intermediary | nghttp2 surfaces as connection error; reconnect with backoff |
| HTTP/1.1 `Upgrade: h2c` proxy stripping `te: trailers` | corporate proxies | spec §7.2: explicit failure with diagnostic; not retried |
| Transparent gzip middlebox compressing already-compressed gRPC | rare, broken middleboxes | decompression error → `malformed_response` |
| Keep-alive PING flood DoS-protection blocking microtel | mTLS + paranoid LB | use nghttp2's PING-rate limits; document tuning if needed |

These hazards inform the §7 test corpus. Each hazard has at least one fixture or test that demonstrates microtel handles it without crashing or hanging.

## 10. What this document does not cover

- The gRPC-side encoding of OTLP **request** payloads — that's the encoder's job (`interfaces.md` §4.2).
- HTTP/2 transport details (TLS, ALPN, reconnect) — that's the transport's job (`architecture.md` §3.6, `interfaces.md` §4.1).
- The decision to treat `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` without `RetryInfo` as non-retryable — recorded in `error-model.md` §7.2 and `microtel-spec.md` §7.2.
- Implementation details of the upb code generation (`gen/` directory contents) — that's the encoder's local concern.
