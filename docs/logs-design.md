# microtel Logs Design

**Status:** Accepted — signed off 2026-08-07 (M14 / v1.3). Precedes the L4/L5
implementation the way `docs/metrics-design.md` (M11) preceded M12. The four
open items are resolved as proposed: share the transport, per-record attribute
cap 128, `LogAttributeLimit` and `GetLogger` land behind ICPs (0011 with L4.1,
and the L5 ICP respectively).

This document settles the pipeline and semantic decisions for the OTel logs
signal so that L4 (SDK log pipeline) and L5 (`Provider::GetLogger` wiring) can be
implemented against a locked design. The L1 protos, L2 API surface
(`Logger`, `LogRecord`, `SeverityNumber`, `LogBatchHandle`), and L3 encoder
(`ILogEncoder`, `OtlpEncoder::Encode(LogBatchHandle)`) already shipped; this doc
retroactively records their contracts and decides everything downstream. It is a
design document, not an interface header: it decides *what* and *why*. Concrete
`include/microtel/` headers it implies are drafted during L4/L5 and, if they
touch a locked surface, follow the ICP process.

The through-line: **the log pipeline mirrors the trace pipeline part-for-part.**
Where a decision could diverge, the default is "do what traces do" unless a
project constraint says otherwise.

## Scope

In scope for v1.3 (this doc decides all of these):

- The SDK log pipeline: `SdkLogger` → `ILogRecordProcessor` → `ILogExporter` →
  `ILogEncoder` (L3, done) → `IWireCodec` → `ITransport`.
- `ILogRecordProcessor` contract + `BatchLogRecordProcessor` (production) and
  `SimpleLogRecordProcessor` (tests), mirroring the span processors.
- `ILogExporter` + `OtlpLogExporter` reusing the OTLP encoder and the shared
  nghttp2 transport.
- Trace correlation from the active span context via the existing
  `ICurrentSpanSource` seam.
- Per-record attribute limits, `observed_time` backfill, and drop accounting.
- `Provider::GetLogger` and `SdkBuilder` wiring (L5).
- Configuration surface (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_*`, `microtel.toml [logs]`).
- The spdlog bridge adapter (L6), specified here, implemented last.

Explicitly **out of scope** (anti-goals):

- Log sampling / filtering beyond severity threshold (v1.4+).
- Log-to-metric or log-to-span derivation.
- Persistence / backfill / disk buffering.
- A second logs transport; logs share the one nghttp2 session.

## Sign-off checklist

Each item has a proposed **Decision** below. Reviewer approves by checking every
box (and editing any decision they want changed first).

- [x] §1 Pipeline shape — mirror traces; share the transport, separate codec + exporter
- [x] §2 Log record processor — `Batch` (prod) + `Simple` (tests); inherit BSP defaults
- [x] §3 Log exporter — `OtlpLogExporter` reusing L3 encoder + shared transport
- [x] §4 Trace correlation — fill from `ICurrentSpanSource` when `trace_id` invalid; on by default
- [x] §5 Attribute limits & drop accounting — new `LogAttributeLimit` **DropReason (ICP)**
- [x] §6 Batching, memory & threading model
- [x] §7 Wire mapping (OTLP logs; encoder/transport reuse)
- [x] §8 Provider / Builder API surface (`GetLogger`)
- [x] §9 Configuration & compatibility
- [x] §10 spdlog bridge adapter

## §1 Pipeline shape

**Decision.** The pipeline is the trace pipeline with `Log` substituted for
`Span`:

```
Logger::Emit(LogRecord)              [caller thread, noexcept]
  → SdkLogger                        stamps observed_time, trace correlation
  → ILogRecordProcessor::OnEmit      enqueue (BatchLogRecordProcessor)
  → worker thread                    drains into LogBatchHandle (records+Resource+Scope)
  → ILogExporter::Export             hand to exporter worker, return
  → ILogEncoder::Encode  [L3 done]   → EncodedPayload (OTLP logs bytes)
  → IWireCodec                       logs endpoint (/v1/logs or LogsService)
  → ITransport                       the one shared nghttp2 session
```

The single `ITransport` (one nghttp2 session) is shared across traces, metrics,
and logs, exactly as metrics reuse it today. Logs add their **own** `IWireCodec`
(pointed at the logs endpoint) and their **own** `ILogExporter` worker, mirroring
`m_metric_codec` / `m_metric_exporter` in `SdkProvider`. Member declaration order
must preserve reverse-destruction (processor torn down before exporter, exporter
before codec/transport), consistent with `SdkProvider`'s documented ordering.

## §2 Log record processor

**Decision.** Two implementations behind one internal interface, mirroring
`ISpanProcessor`:

```cpp
class ILogRecordProcessor {
public:
    virtual ~ILogRecordProcessor() noexcept = default;
    virtual void OnEmit(LogRecord&& record,
                        const InstrumentationScope& scope) noexcept = 0;  // any caller thread
    [[nodiscard]] virtual Status ForceFlush(std::chrono::milliseconds) noexcept = 0;
    [[nodiscard]] virtual Status Shutdown(std::chrono::milliseconds) noexcept = 0;
};
```

- `BatchLogRecordProcessor` — queue + worker + batch, drained on the
  `schedule_delay` timer, on reaching `max_export_batch_size`, or on
  `ForceFlush`. **Inherits the trace BSP defaults:** `max_queue_size = 8192`,
  `max_export_batch_size = 512`, `schedule_delay = 5s`, same
  drop-oldest/drop-newest policy surface.
- `SimpleLogRecordProcessor` — synchronous passthrough, for tests and the dumb
  mock, mirroring `SimpleSpanProcessor`.

There is no `OnStart`/`OnEnd` split — a log record has no lifetime, so the
processor has a single `OnEmit` entry point. Records are grouped into a
`LogBatchHandle` per `(Resource, InstrumentationScope)`; a single flush may
produce more than one handle when a batch spans scopes.

## §3 Log exporter

**Decision.** `ILogExporter` mirrors `IExporter` (same `ExportResult` enum,
same non-blocking `Export`), and `OtlpLogExporter` reuses the L3 `ILogEncoder`
(no new encoding code) plus the shared codec/transport:

```cpp
class ILogExporter {
public:
    virtual ~ILogExporter() noexcept = default;
    [[nodiscard]] virtual ExportResult Export(LogBatchHandle&&) noexcept = 0;
    [[nodiscard]] virtual Status ForceFlush(std::chrono::milliseconds) noexcept = 0;
    [[nodiscard]] virtual Status Shutdown(std::chrono::milliseconds) noexcept = 0;
};
```

`ExportResult` (`Success`/`Failure`/`Dropped`/`AlreadyShutDown`) is reused
verbatim from `internal/exporter.hpp` — no new enum. Retry classification,
partial-success parsing, and drop accounting reuse the same machinery as the
trace and metric exporters.

## §4 Trace correlation

**Decision.** On by default. When `Emit()` is called with `trace_id` left as the
invalid all-zeros default and a span is active on the calling thread, `SdkLogger`
fills `trace_id`, `span_id`, and `trace_flags` from
`ICurrentSpanSource::GetCurrentSpan()` — the same seam metrics already use for
exemplars. If the caller set `trace_id` explicitly, the SDK never overwrites it.
Correlation is disabled by a builder flag / `microtel.toml` setting for callers
who bridge already-correlated records.

`observed_time` is stamped to `system_clock::now()` at `Emit()` when unset;
`time` is left untouched (0 = unknown, per the L2 header contract).

## §5 Attribute limits & drop accounting

**Decision.** A per-record attribute cap (default 128, configurable) is enforced
at `Emit()`; excess attributes are dropped and `dropped_attributes_count` is
incremented on the record, matching the OTLP field already present in
`LogRecord`.

Drop reasons reuse the existing `DropReason` taxonomy where they apply:
`QueueFull` (queue saturated), `PostShutdown` (emit after shutdown),
`RecordTooLarge` (oversized encoded record). The per-record attribute cap needs a
**new enumerator `LogAttributeLimit`** — and because every `DropReason` is part
of the public `HealthSnapshot` counter array (the header calls adding one an ICP,
the same rule that produced ICP 0008 for metrics), **this requires an ICP** to be
merged before L4 lands. Flagged as an open item below.

## §6 Batching, memory & threading model

**Decision.** Same three-thread model as traces:

- **Caller thread** — `Emit()` stamps time/correlation, moves the record into the
  processor queue, returns. `noexcept`, never blocks on I/O.
- **Log worker thread** (one, owned by `BatchLogRecordProcessor`) — drains the
  queue into `LogBatchHandle`s and calls `ILogExporter::Export`.
- **Exporter worker + I/O thread** — the shared nghttp2 machinery.

`LogRecord` and `LogBatchHandle` are move-only and RAII-owned; the batch owns its
records `vector`, a `shared_ptr<const Resource>`, and the scope. No record is
copied on the hot path. TSAN must be run when touching the processor/worker
handoff (per CLAUDE.md threading discipline).

## §7 Wire mapping

**Decision.** Already implemented in L3 and unchanged: `LogBatchHandle` →
`ExportLogsServiceRequest` (`ResourceLogs` → `ScopeLogs` → `LogRecord`) via
`OtlpEncoder::Encode`. The HTTP path posts to `/v1/logs`; the gRPC path calls
`opentelemetry.proto.collector.logs.v1.LogsService/Export`. Both reuse the
existing `HttpWireCodec` / `GrpcWireCodec` with the logs endpoint substituted.

## §8 Provider / Builder API surface (L5)

**Decision.** `Provider` gains:

```cpp
[[nodiscard]] virtual std::shared_ptr<Logger>
GetLogger(std::string_view name, std::string_view version = {}) = 0;
```

`SdkProvider::GetLogger` lazily creates the log pipeline on first call (mirroring
the lazy metrics `GetMeter`), caches `SdkLogger`s per `(name, version)`, and
returns a shared no-op logger when no logs exporter is configured. `SdkBuilder`
gains `WithLogExporter(...)` (or auto-enables logs when a logs endpoint is
configured). Adding a pure-virtual method to the public `Provider` is a breaking
change to a locked interface → **L5 lands behind its own ICP.**

## §9 Configuration & compatibility

**Decision.** Standard OTel env precedence: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT`,
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_PROTOCOL`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_HEADERS`, falling
back to the generic `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*`. `microtel.toml` gains a `[logs]`
section paralleling `[traces]`/`[metrics]`, with `endpoint`, `protocol`,
`batch`, and `correlation` keys. Logs are opt-in: absent any logs config, the
provider returns no-op loggers and spins up no log worker.

## §10 Log bridge adapters (L6, #304)

**Decision.** Shipped as a separate adapter target (like the experimental compat
shims), not linked into the core. A `SpdlogSink` implements `spdlog::sinks::sink`
and forwards each `spdlog::details::log_msg` to a `Logger::Emit`, mapping spdlog
levels → `SeverityNumber` and the formatted payload → `LogRecord::body`. It is
the only place logs depend on the optional spdlog dependency; core builds without
it. Implemented after L4/L5 so it targets a stable `Logger`.

**glog and log4cxx (v1.2, issue #304)** follow the same shape: one header-only
public header each, an INTERFACE target, off by default.

| Bridge | Header | Option | Supported versions | Registration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| spdlog | `microtel/adapters/spdlog_sink.hpp` | `MICROTEL_USE_SPDLOG` (on) | the FetchContent pin | `std::make_shared<SpdlogSinkMt>(logger)` on an `spdlog::logger` |
| glog | `microtel/adapters/glog_sink.hpp` | `MICROTEL_BUILD_GLOG_BRIDGE` (off) | 0.6.x, 0.7.x | `GlogSink` registers with `google::AddLogSink` on construction and unregisters on destruction |
| log4cxx | `microtel/adapters/log4cxx_appender.hpp` | `MICROTEL_BUILD_LOG4CXX_BRIDGE` (off) | 1.1 and later | `logger->addAppender(std::make_shared<Log4cxxAppender>(logger))`; `removeAppender` or `close()` stops it |

Severity follows the Logs Data Model's base values:

| Native | glog | log4cxx | `SeverityNumber` |
|---|---|---|---|
| trace | — | `TRACE` (and below) | `Trace` (1) |
| debug | — | `DEBUG` | `Debug` (5) |
| info | `INFO`, every `VLOG(n)` | `INFO` | `Info` (9) |
| warn | `WARNING` | `WARN` | `Warn` (13) |
| error | `ERROR` | `ERROR` | `Error` (17) |
| fatal | `FATAL` | `FATAL` | `Fatal` (21) |

glog does not pass the `VLOG` verbosity to a `LogSink`, so verbose messages
arrive as `INFO` and are mapped as such. A custom log4cxx level maps to the
base severity of the highest standard level at or below it. `severity_text` is
the native level name; `body` is the message text; `time` is the native event
timestamp (microsecond resolution in both libraries).

Call-site location uses the current semantic-convention names —
`code.file.path`, `code.line.number`, `code.function.name` (the deprecated
`code.filepath` / `code.lineno` / `code.function` are not emitted). glog
reports file and line only; log4cxx reports all three when the location is
known, the function as `ns::Class::method` parsed from `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__`.
log4cxx MDC entries become string attributes under their own keys; the NDC
and the log4cxx logger name are not mapped (the scope is the microtel `Logger`
the appender was built with).

Neither bridge does anything on the logging thread beyond building the record
and calling `Logger::Emit`, which is where trace correlation happens (§4): both
libraries call their sinks synchronously on the thread that logged, so a record
logged inside an active span carries its ids. A record emitted after the
provider shut down is dropped and counted under `DropReason::PostShutdown`, as
for any `Logger`. Both conversion paths are `noexcept`.

**Link closure.** Neither glog nor log4cxx joins rule 12's closure. The bridges
compile against the headers already in the consumer's build (ICP 0014's
source-distributed allowance); their headers install with the rest of
`include/microtel/` and no bridge target is exported (ICP 0020 Decision 3).
`ci/scripts/symbol-scan.sh` has a third pass that fails any shipped archive
defining or referencing a `google::`, `gflags::`, `fL?::` or `log4cxx::` symbol.

## Open items flagged for the reviewer

1. **`LogAttributeLimit` DropReason (§5) requires an ICP** before L4 lands —
   it extends the public `HealthSnapshot` counter array. Recommend authoring it
   alongside L4.1 so the counter exists when the processor needs it.
2. **`Provider::GetLogger` (§8) is a locked-interface change → L5 ICP.**
3. **Shared vs. separate transport (§1):** decision is *share* the one nghttp2
   session. Confirm this is acceptable head-of-line-blocking-wise, or whether
   logs warrant a second session (would be a dependency-closure change).
4. **Default per-record attribute cap (§5) = 128** — confirm, or align to
   whatever the span attribute default settles at.

## Increment plan

- **L4.1** — `ILogRecordProcessor` + `SdkLogger` (Emit → processor; time stamp +
  correlation seam), dumb mock + fake. Ships the `LogAttributeLimit` ICP.
- **L4.2** — `BatchLogRecordProcessor` + `SimpleLogRecordProcessor`.
- **L4.3** — `ILogExporter` + `OtlpLogExporter` (reuses L3 encoder + transport).
- **L5** — `Provider::GetLogger` + `SdkBuilder` wiring (behind an ICP).
- **L6** — spdlog bridge adapter.
