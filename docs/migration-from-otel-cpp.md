# Migrating from opentelemetry-cpp

**Status:** M17 L6 deliverable. Validated against the working shim (M17 L1–L5,
`tests/integration/otelcpp_shim/wire_conformance_test.cpp`) — every claim below
is backed by a passing test, not aspiration.
**Companion:** [ICP 0014](icps/0014-otelcpp-shim-and-rule-13.md) (shim design
and distribution model), [ICP 0015](icps/0015-unrepresentable-attribute-policy.md)
(attribute-value policy), [ICP 0016](icps/0016-adapter-drop-accounting.md)
(draft — measurement-drop accounting), [`configuration.md`](configuration.md)
(env-var / `microtel.toml` reference), [`src/adapters/otelcpp/README.md`](../src/adapters/otelcpp/README.md)
(implementation-level detail).

## Who this is for

You have a codebase already instrumented against `opentelemetry-cpp` — call
sites doing `tracer->StartSpan(...)`, `meter->CreateUInt64Counter(...)`,
`logger->EmitLogRecord(...)` — and you want microtel's runtime and OTLP
exporter underneath it, without the gRPC / protobuf / abseil dependency tree
opentelemetry-cpp's SDK and exporters bring in. This is Tier 3 in
`microtel-spec.md` §2.2 ("API-adapter compatibility"), **experimental**: the
supported subset is exactly what this document and `src/adapters/otelcpp/`
implement, no more.

**What does not change:** every call site that creates spans, records
metrics, or emits logs through the `opentelemetry-cpp` API. That is the whole
point — read on for the one thing that does change (how the provider is
constructed at startup).

## Quick start

```cpp
// startup.cpp — the only file that changes.
#include "adapters/otelcpp/global_registration.hpp"
#include "microtel/sdk_builder.hpp"

auto provider = microtel::SdkBuilder()
                    .WithEndpoint("https://otel-collector.internal:4318")
                    .WithServiceName("my-service")
                    .Build();
if (!provider)
{
    // handle provider.error() — see error-model.md §8
}

// Provider::Connect() is NOT automatic — see "Known gaps" below. Skipping
// this call is the single most common way to get an experimental-looking
// silent failure out of this shim.
if (!(*provider)->Connect())
{
    // handle the connection error
}

microtel::adapters::otelcpp::RegisterGlobally(*provider);

// From here on, every existing opentelemetry-cpp call site — anywhere in the
// program, in any translation unit — routes to microtel with zero edits.
```

Everything after `RegisterGlobally` is unmodified `opentelemetry-cpp`
application code. `otel_trace::Provider::GetTracerProvider()`,
`otel_metrics::Provider::GetMeterProvider()`,
`otel_logs::Provider::GetLoggerProvider()` all now resolve to microtel.

If you only use one signal, `MakeTracerProvider` / `MakeMeterProvider` /
`MakeLoggerProvider` (declared alongside each signal's shim header) let you
register just that one via the signal's own `Provider::SetXProvider` call.

## Dependency-graph diff

This is the reason to migrate. Numbers are from ICP 0014, measured against
opentelemetry-cpp v1.19.0 and re-verified at v1.28.0.

| | opentelemetry-cpp (SDK + OTLP exporter) | microtel + shim |
|---|---|---|
| gRPC library | required for OTLP/gRPC | never linked (rule 13, `symbol-scan.sh`) |
| protobuf C++ runtime | required (SDK serialization) | never linked — wire encoding is upb |
| abseil | vendored inside the API headers under the *default* config (`WITH_STL=OFF`); 30 headers enter the include graph | **0** under `OPENTELEMETRY_STL_VERSION=2020`, which the shim pins |
| libcurl | required by the default HTTP exporter | never linked — transport is nghttp2 directly |
| Wire transport | gRPC-over-HTTP/2 or libcurl | nghttp2 directly, both protocols |

The abseil elimination is the one requiring your action: it only happens if
your **own** application code also builds against `OPENTELEMETRY_STL_VERSION=2020`
(see below) — otherwise your call sites still pull the vendored-abseil headers
even though the shim itself doesn't need them.

## Build-system changes

### 1. Remove opentelemetry-cpp's SDK and exporter targets

Your `CMakeLists.txt` currently links something like
`opentelemetry_trace`, `opentelemetry_metrics`, `opentelemetry_logs`,
`opentelemetry_exporter_otlp_http`, `opentelemetry_otlp_recordable`. Delete
all of it — the shim replaces the SDK+exporter stack entirely. Keep only the
**API** dependency (see below); nothing else about your build references
opentelemetry-cpp by name anymore.

### 2. Add microtel with the shim enabled

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(microtel
    GIT_REPOSITORY <your-microtel-remote>
    GIT_TAG        <pinned-tag>)
set(MICROTEL_BUILD_OTELCPP_SHIM ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(microtel)

target_link_libraries(your_app PRIVATE microtel_sdk microtel_otelcpp_shim)
```

`MICROTEL_BUILD_OTELCPP_SHIM=ON` makes microtel's own build fetch
opentelemetry-cpp's API headers (pinned at v1.28.0, `SOURCE_SUBDIR api/include`
so only the header-only API is populated — its SDK/exporter CMake project
never runs). This is a **build-time** dependency of the shim only; it adds
nothing to microtel's own runtime closure (rule 12).

### 3. Point your own translation units at the same otel-cpp configuration

**This is the step migrations most often get wrong, and getting it wrong is
silent.** `microtel_otelcpp_shim` sets `OPENTELEMETRY_STL_VERSION=2020` and
`OPENTELEMETRY_ABI_VERSION_NO=1` for its own compilation, but your
application's `.cpp` files that `#include <opentelemetry/...>` headers need
the identical two defines — otel-cpp's ABI is a function of them (ICP 0014
§"constraint"), and a mismatch produces link-incompatible symbols, not a
compile error. Link `microtel_otelcpp_shim` on **every** target that includes
an `opentelemetry/` header, not only the target that calls `RegisterGlobally`:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_instrumented_library PRIVATE microtel_otelcpp_shim)
```

If you get this wrong on ABI version specifically, you get a clear, actionable
`#error` instead of a mysterious link failure — `src/adapters/otelcpp/abi_guard.hpp`,
included from every shim header, fails the build by name
(`OPENTELEMETRY_ABI_VERSION_NO != 1`, or
`OPENTELEMETRY_HAVE_METRICS_BOUND_INSTRUMENTS_PREVIEW` defined) rather than
producing "cannot instantiate abstract class" forty lines into a template
instantiation. There is currently no equivalent guard for
`OPENTELEMETRY_STL_VERSION` mismatches specifically — those manifest as the
ABI-mismatch link failures ICP 0014 describes.

### 4. `src/` is on the public include path

`microtel_otelcpp_shim` exposes both microtel's public `include/microtel/`
headers and `src/` itself — the shim's own implementation headers
(`tracer_shim.hpp`, `meter_shim.hpp`, `logger_shim.hpp`,
`global_registration.hpp`, …) live under `src/adapters/otelcpp/` and include
each other by that path, so `src/` has to be reachable for a consumer linking
only `microtel_otelcpp_shim` to resolve them. No extra
`target_include_directories` call needed on your side — linking the target is
enough. (Note for anyone reading an old checkout: earlier versions of this
target exposed only `include/`, requiring a manual `-Isrc` workaround; that
gap is closed. `tests/unit/adapters/otelcpp_shim_public_include_test.cpp` is
the regression test.)

## API import changes

None, at call sites. Replace only:

| Was | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `#include <opentelemetry/sdk/trace/...>`, `.../exporters/otlp/...` (SDK/exporter construction headers) | `#include "adapters/otelcpp/global_registration.hpp"`, `#include "microtel/sdk_builder.hpp"` |
| Your own `TracerProvider`/`MeterProvider`/`LoggerProvider` construction code (whatever built your `BatchSpanProcessor`, `OtlpHttpExporter`, etc.) | `microtel::SdkBuilder{...}.Build()` + `RegisterGlobally(provider)` |
| `#include <opentelemetry/trace/tracer.h>`, `.../metrics/meter.h`, `.../logs/logger.h`, and all `opentelemetry::trace` / `::metrics` / `::logs` call sites | **unchanged** |

## Configuration: env vars and `microtel.toml`

microtel resolves `OTEL_*` env vars directly — see
[`configuration.md`](configuration.md) §3 for the complete, authoritative
per-setting table (endpoint, protocol, compression, headers, batch options,
span limits, sampler, and more, each with its `OTEL_*` name, its
`microtel.toml` key, and its `SdkBuilder` method). It is not reproduced here
to avoid the table drifting out of sync with itself in two places; if your
deployment already sets `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`,
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`, `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, etc., microtel reads
them with no changes on your part, precedence: code > env > `microtel.toml` >
defaults (`configuration.md` §1).

Two things worth knowing:

- Per-signal env vars for signals v1 doesn't yet resolve independently (e.g.
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` as distinct from the unsigned
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`) are **ignored, not rejected**
  (`configuration.md` §2.2).
- There is no `microtel.toml` equivalent of opentelemetry-cpp's own YAML
  declarative-configuration file format. Translate your settings to the
  `SdkBuilder` calls or the env vars in the referenced table.

## Behavioral differences — read this before production

Every row is backed by a test. Where a row references ICP 0015, the shim's
governing principle is: **preserve or omit, never invent** — a converted
value is always either exact or absent, never a plausible-looking fabrication.

| Area | Behavior | Why | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`Provider::Connect()` is not automatic** | Every export fails fast with "not connected" until you call `provider->Connect()` explicitly, despite `Provider::Connect()`'s own doc saying the connection is "established lazily on the first export." Nothing in the export path currently implements that lazy path. | Found while building this guide's own conformance test — reproduced with microtel's native API, no shim involved, before concluding it wasn't a shim bug. | `include/microtel/provider.hpp` `Connect()` Doxygen vs. `src/exporter/otlp_exporter.cpp` / `src/transport/http2_transport.cpp` (`Send()` requires `ConnectionState::Connected`) |
| `uint64_t` attribute above `INT64_MAX` | Arrives as its **exact decimal digits**, as a string. Type changes; value doesn't. | ICP 0015 | `otelcpp_attribute_conversion_test.cpp` |
| `span<const uint64_t>` with any such element | **Every** element in the array renders as a decimal string, not just the offending one — arrays can't hold mixed types, and dropping one element would silently shift index correlation with a parallel attribute. | ICP 0015 | `otelcpp_attribute_conversion_test.cpp` |
| `span<const uint8_t>` (byte attributes) | Lowercase hex string, no separators. `microtel::AttributeValue` has no bytes variant. | ICP 0015 | `otelcpp_attribute_conversion_test.cpp` |
| `uint64_t` **measurement** (Counter/Histogram) above `INT64_MAX` | **Omitted**, not wrapped to negative and not clamped. Unlike attributes, there is no degraded string form for a measurement — the instrument only accepts numbers. Silently dropped: no diagnostic counter increments yet (ICP 0016 is drafted, not implemented). | ICP 0015's principle, extended; ICP 0016 (draft) | `metrics_instruments_shim.hpp`, `otelcpp_meter_shim_test.cpp` |
| `LogRecord::SetEventId(id, name)` | The `name` half survives into `event_name`; the numeric `id` has no microtel field and is dropped. | `microtel::LogRecord` has no integer event-id slot | `log_record_shim.hpp`, `otelcpp_log_record_shim_test.cpp` |
| `TraceState` | Does **not** round-trip. `microtel::TraceState` has no storage or `FromHeader`/`ToHeader` implementation yet; both directions produce the empty default. | `context_conversion.hpp`'s file comment | `otelcpp_context_conversion_test.cpp` |
| `schema_url` on `GetTracer` | **Dropped.** `microtel::Provider::GetTracer` has no such parameter. | — | `tracer_shim.hpp` |
| `schema_url` on `GetMeter` | **Passed through.** `microtel::Provider::GetMeter` does carry it. | Deliberate asymmetry — do not "fix" one to match the other; `microtel::Provider`'s own surface differs per signal. | `meter_shim.hpp` |
| `schema_url` / `attributes` on `GetLogger` | **Dropped.** `microtel::Provider::GetLogger` has neither parameter. | — | `logger_shim.hpp` |
| `GetLogger(logger_name, name, ...)` scope naming | If `name` is empty, the instrumentation-scope name resolves to `logger_name` — matching the reference opentelemetry-cpp SDK's own behavior (`if (name.empty()) name = logger_name;`), not a guess. Every ordinary single-argument call (`GetLogger("my.lib")`) depends on this. | Verified against vendored opentelemetry-cpp SDK source, `sdk/src/logs/logger_provider.cc` | `otelcpp_logger_shim_test.cpp` |
| Sync `Gauge` instrument | **Unavailable.** `Meter::CreateInt64Gauge`/`CreateDoubleGauge` are ABI v2; the shim pins ABI v1. Use `CreateInt64ObservableGauge`/`CreateDoubleObservableGauge` instead — those are ABI v1 and fully supported. | ABI v1 pin | `abi_guard.hpp` |
| `Counter<T>::Bind()` / bound instruments | **Unavailable.** Gated behind `OPENTELEMETRY_HAVE_METRICS_BOUND_INSTRUMENTS_PREVIEW`, which the shim's pinned config does not define. Building with that macro defined fails the build immediately with a named `#error` rather than a template-instantiation cascade. | Preview feature, not implemented | `abi_guard.hpp` |
| `Span::AddLink()` (post-creation link) | **Unavailable.** ABI v2. Links are only accepted at `StartSpan` time, via the `links` parameter — otel-cpp's own ABI-v1 surface. | ABI v1 pin | `otelcpp_tracer_shim_test.cpp` (`LinksForwardViaAddLinkWithConvertedAttributes`) |
| Default parent when otel's `parent` option is unset | Inherits the **currently active span** (`trace::Scope` / `WithActiveSpan`) if one exists on the thread, matching otel-cpp semantics — microtel's own native API defers this current-context inheritance to v1.1. | Precedence: explicit valid `SpanContext` > `is_root_span`-flagged `Context` > `Context`-carried span > active `Scope` > unset (root) | `otelcpp_tracer_shim_test.cpp` |
| Observable metric callback throws | **Contained at the shim boundary**, not propagated. otel-cpp does not require observer callbacks to be `noexcept`; microtel's collection path is. One throwing callback costs neither the process nor other callbacks' observations in the same collection cycle. | — | `otelcpp_meter_shim_test.cpp` (`ThrowingCallbackCostsNeitherTheProcessNorTheOtherCallbacks`) |
| Observable callback self-removal | A callback may call `RemoveCallback` on itself during its own invocation (e.g. after a terminal observation) without deadlocking. Removal takes effect from the *next* collection cycle, matching otel-cpp's own SDK guarantee. | — | `otelcpp_meter_shim_test.cpp` (`CallbackMayRemoveItselfDuringCollectionWithoutDeadlock`) |
| `TracerShim::CloseWithMicroseconds` | Shuts down the **entire microtel provider**, not just the tracer. otel-cpp puts flush/close on the tracer; microtel puts them on the provider. Same blast radius otel-cpp's own SDK has (closing one tracer shuts the shared processor pipeline). | — | `tracer_shim.hpp` |

## Validation

Every claim above and in the dependency-graph diff is exercised by an
automated test, not asserted in prose alone:

- `tests/unit/adapters/otelcpp_*_test.cpp` — one file per shim layer
  (attribute/context conversion, span, tracer, meter, logger, global
  registration), against fakes.
- `tests/integration/otelcpp_shim/wire_conformance_test.cpp` — the one that
  matters most for this document: a real `SdkBuilder`-built `Provider`, driven
  purely through the `opentelemetry-cpp` API via `RegisterGlobally`, over a
  real loopback HTTP/2 connection, with the captured request bytes decoded
  with upb and checked against exactly what the otel-cpp calls set — proving
  the whole chain end to end, not just that calls reach an in-memory fake.

Run `ctest --test-dir build -R otelcpp` after configuring with
`-DMICROTEL_BUILD_OTELCPP_SHIM=ON` to reproduce all of it locally.

## What this document does not cover

- **opentelemetry-python.** Out of scope for this shim; see the Python
  bindings milestone (M18, ICP 0013) for microtel's own Python story, which is
  not an opentelemetry-python adapter.
- **A Tier-1/Tier-2 compatibility matrix** against specific collector or
  backend versions — that's `docs/interop-matrix.md`, not yet written.
- **Auto-instrumentation.** Both opentelemetry-cpp and microtel are manual
  instrumentation only in v1 (spec §3).
