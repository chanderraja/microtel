# Usage:  examples/stack/up.sh
#
# Environment overrides:
#   MICROTEL_CONTAINER_ENGINE   podman | docker   (default: podman if present)
#   MICROTEL_STACK_TIMEOUT      readiness timeout in seconds (default: 180)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all three services answered their health endpoints
#   1  the stack could not be started, or something never came up

  Stack is up.

  Grafana:   http://localhost:3000  —  Explore → Tempo  (no login; anonymous
             admin). The "microtel — recent traces" dashboard is the home page
             and lists every trace Tempo has; click a row for the flame graph.

  Examples export to:
    OTLP/gRPC   http://localhost:4317    <- the default; use this
    OTLP/HTTP   https://localhost:4318   <- TLS only, see the h2c note in
                                            docs/compatibility-matrix.md §4

  Tempo query API:  http://localhost:3200
    curl -s "http://localhost:3200/api/traces/<trace-id>" | head -c 400
