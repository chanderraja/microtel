/// These constants are hand-set and must be kept equal to the `VERSION` given
/// to `project(microtel …)` in the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`. Generating this
/// header from `PROJECT_VERSION` at configure time is deferred past v1.0: it
/// would make the public API depend on a configured build directory, which the
/// header-only `microtel_headers` target and the M0 header check do not have.
///
/// A release bump therefore edits this header, `CMakeLists.txt`, the gRPC
/// user-agent literal in `src/wire/grpc/grpc_wire_codec.cpp`, and `kVersion` in
/// `tools/preflight/preflight.cpp`. The user-agent carries a `static_assert`
/// against `kVersionString`; the preflight literal does not, and was out of step
/// from M6-D until 1.0.0 shipped. `ci/scripts/version-drift-check.sh` (CI job
/// `version-drift-check`) now compares all of them against `PROJECT_VERSION`.
/// The procedure is in `RELEASING.md`.
