/**
 * @file leaf.h
 * @brief microtel-leaf: build spans in caller-owned memory and encode them as
 *        an OTLP ExportTraceServiceRequest.
 *
 * **Experimental in v1.2.** This C API may change in any 1.x minor release; it
 * becomes stable in v2.0. The design is `docs/leaf-concentrator-design.md` §1.
 *
 * The leaf never allocates. The caller provides the leaf state
 * (`microtel_leaf_t`), a record buffer that holds every started span until it
 * is encoded, and an output buffer (or a write callback) per encode. It starts
 * no thread, does no I/O and does not frame its payloads: the application owns
 * the transport and sends the bytes to a concentrator (`LeafReceiver`).
 *
 * A `microtel_leaf_t` is not thread-safe. Serialise access to one leaf, or use
 * one leaf per execution context.
 *
 * Every string parameter is UTF-8 with an explicit length and is copied into
 * the record buffer, so the caller's pointer need only be valid for the call.
 * The leaf does not validate UTF-8; the concentrator rejects a payload that is
 * not valid UTF-8.
 *
 * **Ids on weak entropy (§1.6.1).** Ids are never taken from `random_bytes`
 * directly: each 64-bit id word is `splitmix64(device_key + counter) XOR
 * random`, where `device_key` hashes the configured Resource and `boot_id`. A
 * fleet whose `random_bytes` is the same PRNG sequence on every device still
 * gets distinct ids, as long as the Resource names the device (`device.id`,
 * `service.instance.id`, a serial number) and `boot_id` changes per boot. What
 * this cannot fix: a fleet whose PRNG, Resource and `boot_id` are all identical
 * on every device produces the same ids everywhere.
 *
 * Valid C11 (`-std=c11 -pedantic-errors`) and valid C++.
