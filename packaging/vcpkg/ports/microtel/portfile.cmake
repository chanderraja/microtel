# vcpkg overlay port for microtel. See README.md beside this file.
#
# Not a curated-registry port: microtel does not yet meet the registry's
# six-month maturity rule, and it vendors upb, utf8_range and nanopb under
# renamed symbols (docs/packaging-research.md §3.3 and §4).

# microtel installs static archives only (every library is hard-coded STATIC),
# so a dynamic triplet still gets static archives.
vcpkg_check_linkage(ONLY_STATIC_LIBRARY)

# Source: the release tag matching the port's version. Update version and
# SHA512 together at each release (RELEASING.md). `vcpkg install --head`
# builds the tip of master instead.
#
# MICROTEL_SOURCE_DIR in the environment builds a local checkout instead, for
# testing changes to microtel or to this port before they are released. vcpkg's
# binary cache keys on the port files, not on that directory, so pass
# --binarysource=clear when using it, or a stale cached build is reused.
