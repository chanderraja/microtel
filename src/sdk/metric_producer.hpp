/// @brief Concrete `IMetricProducer` — the pull source for `IMetricReader`.
///
/// Holds one `ScopeEntry` per instrumentation scope (grouped by name+version).
/// Each entry owns its `IMetricStream` instances. `Collect()` loops over scopes
/// and streams, snapshots each stream's aggregation state, and assembles one
/// `MetricBatchHandle` per scope.
///
/// Streams are registered via `AddStream` whenever the application creates an
/// instrument — **not** only at SDK-build time, as this comment previously
/// claimed. Every `SdkMeter::Create*` reaches it (25 call sites), so
/// registration races collection on the reader thread unless synchronised.
/// There is no removal API in v1.2, which is what makes the borrowed-pointer
/// snapshot in `Collect` safe: a stream, once added, lives as long as the
/// producer.
///
/// The producer is also the owner of what the streams' storage borrows: the
/// diagnostics sink and the current-span source. `SdkProvider`, every
/// `SdkMeter` and every synchronous instrument share the producer, so a meter
/// or instrument that outlives its provider still writes into live memory
/// (issue #259). Nothing collects from it once the provider is gone.
///
/// @threadsafety Thread-safe. `AddStream` and `Collect` may be called
/// concurrently from different threads. `Collect` snapshots the scope/stream
/// structure under `m_mu`, releases it, and only then calls into each stream —
/// so the producer's mutex is never held while a per-instrument mutex is
/// acquired (`docs/threading-model.md` §4).
