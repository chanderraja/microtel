/// @brief Push-model `IMetricReader` that drives collect+export on a background
/// thread at a configurable interval (default 60 s per metrics-design.md §5).
///
/// Three call paths trigger a synchronous collect+export cycle:
///  - Background thread fires at each `interval` tick.
///  - `Collect(timeout)` — manual, caller-thread invocation.
///  - `ForceFlush(timeout)` — immediate caller-thread cycle, then delegates
///    to the exporter's `ForceFlush`.
///
/// `Shutdown(timeout)` wakes the background thread for a final cycle, waits
/// for it to exit, then delegates to the exporter's `Shutdown`.
///
/// Concurrent calls to `Collect`, `ForceFlush`, and the background thread are
/// serialized so that one interval's deltas are never split across two
/// exports. The serialization is a `m_collecting` flag guarded by
/// `m_collect_mu` rather than the mutex being held for the whole cycle:
/// `MetricProducer::Collect` and `IMetricExporter::Export` each take their own
/// lock, so holding `m_collect_mu` across them nested two non-leaf locks —
/// which `docs/threading-model.md` §4 marks LOCKED against. The flag gives the
/// same mutual exclusion while `m_collect_mu` stays a leaf.
///
/// `final` is load-bearing, not decoration. The destructor calls `Shutdown()`,
/// a virtual — in a base class that would statically bind to this class's
/// override while a derived object's own `Shutdown` was skipped, because the
/// derived part is already destroyed by the time the base destructor runs.
/// Sealing the class makes the call unambiguously correct rather than
/// correct-until-someone-subclasses-it. A future reader that needs different
/// shutdown behaviour implements `IMetricReader` directly.
///
/// @threadsafety Thread-safe.
/// @noexcept All public methods; background thread entry point.
