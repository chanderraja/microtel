/// message as their merge, which appends repeated fields. So the bytes of A
/// followed by the bytes of B are, exactly, a valid request whose
/// `resource_spans` are A's followed by B's
/// (`docs/leaf-concentrator-design.md` §3.6.1). This holds for this message
/// only; it is not a general way to merge OTLP payloads.
///
/// Byte-level: no upb is involved, and nothing is parsed or validated.
///
/// @param parts the encodings, in request order. Consumed. Empty parts
///        contribute nothing.
/// @return one payload. A single part is returned as is, with no copy.
/// @throws std::bad_alloc if the joined buffer cannot be allocated.
