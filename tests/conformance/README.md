# `tests/conformance/`

End-to-end tests against a real OpenTelemetry Collector: eleven test
binaries holding 41 tests, none of them disabled. Every test skips
unless [`ci/scripts/conformance.sh`](../../ci/scripts/conformance.sh)
has started a collector and exported the environment contract below.

## What this proves

Tier 1 of the four-tier compatibility model in `microtel-spec.md` §2.2:
payloads emitted by microtel are accepted by receivers implementing the
pinned OTLP specification version, over both OTLP/HTTP-protobuf and
OTLP/gRPC. Traces and logs are covered; metrics are not yet (see
"Deliberately excluded").

This is a release gate per spec §13.5:

> OTLP/HTTP trace export passes integration tests against the pinned
> OpenTelemetry Collector matrix.
> OTLP/gRPC trace export passes integration tests against the pinned
> OpenTelemetry Collector matrix.

## Boundary vs. the other tiers

A real receiver is the only thing that proves acceptance. Every other
tier has microtel, or a peer microtel's authors wrote, on both sides
of the wire, so a green run there says the client agrees with itself.

- `unit/` tests one type against mocks. That includes the byte-level
  wire corpus under [`tests/unit/wire/`](../unit/wire/): what microtel
  *writes*, asserted against hand-encoded byte fixtures in the test
  sources.
- `integration/` wires real components together against fakes at the
  system boundary (sockets, the clock).
- `conformance/` sends the bytes out of the process to a receiver
  written by the OpenTelemetry and gRPC projects. The assertions read
  the collector's own output, which is downstream of its protobuf
  decode.

Consequence, enforced in [`CMakeLists.txt`](CMakeLists.txt):
`${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src` is **not** on the include path here. A test
that needs an internal header to make its point belongs in the
integration tier.

## Layout

### `http/` — OTLP/HTTP-protobuf, 6 binaries

| Binary | Source | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| `conformance_http_basic_test` | `basic_export_test.cpp` | `Connect()` preflight; one span's full round trip |
| `conformance_http_batching_test` | `batching_test.cpp` | multi-batch exactly-once, gzip, multi-DATA-frame body |
| `conformance_http_tls_test` | `tls_test.cpp` | custom CA, mTLS, SNI override, and two negative cases |
| `conformance_http_auth_test` | `auth_test.cpp` | static bearer header, auth callback, wrong-token 401 |
| `conformance_http_plaintext_gap_test` | `plaintext_gap_test.cpp` | pins the plaintext gap as a failure — issue #166 |
| `conformance_http_logs_test` | `logs_test.cpp` | logs to `/v1/logs`: see [Logs](#logs) |

### `grpc/` — OTLP/gRPC, 5 binaries

| Binary | Source | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| `conformance_grpc_basic_test` | `basic_export_test.cpp` | `Connect()` preflight; one span's full round trip |
| `conformance_grpc_batching_test` | `batching_test.cpp` | multi-RPC exactly-once, `grpc-encoding: gzip`, message spanning DATA frames |
| `conformance_grpc_tls_test` | `tls_test.cpp` | custom CA, mTLS, SNI override, and two negative cases |
| `conformance_grpc_auth_test` | `auth_test.cpp` | static bearer header, auth callback, wrong-token `grpc-status: 16` |
| `conformance_grpc_logs_test` | `logs_test.cpp` | logs to `LogsService/Export`: see [Logs](#logs) |

There is no gRPC mirror of `plaintext_gap_test.cpp`: the gRPC suite
runs over `http://` except for `tls_test.cpp`, and that is the answer
to it.

One binary per theme rather than one per directory. A conformance
binary is bounded by a ctest `TIMEOUT` covering a flush plus a poll of
the collector's output file; a single binary would make that budget the
sum of every theme's worst case.

### Logs

Both `logs_test.cpp` files run the same six scenarios, defined once in
[`support/log_conformance.hpp`](support/log_conformance.hpp); each file only
decides how its `Provider` reaches the collector (HTTP over the TLS receiver,
gRPC over plaintext, exactly as the trace suites do).

| Test | What the collector must have decoded |
|---|---|
| `RecordRoundTrip` | one record, exactly once: `time` and `observed_time`, severity number and text, a string body, one attribute of each scalar type, `droppedAttributesCount`, `eventName`; `service.name` on its `ResourceLogs`, the `GetLogger(name, version)` scope on its `ScopeLogs`; no trace ids |
| `EverySeverity` | all 25 `SeverityNumber` values, 0 (the proto default, so absent) to 24 |
| `BodyTypes` | a body of each `AttributeValue` alternative: four scalars and four homogeneous arrays |
| `ObservedTimeBackfilled` | a record with neither timestamp: no `timeUnixNano`, and an `observedTimeUnixNano` inside the `Emit()` window |
| `TraceCorrelation` | a record emitted inside `StartAsCurrentSpan` carries that span's `traceId`, `spanId` and `flags: 1`; its sibling emitted after the scope closed carries none of the three |
| `GzipAccepted` | 50 records through a gzip-compressed provider, each exactly once |

A key/value-list (structured map) body is not tested because the public
`LogRecord::body` cannot hold one: `AttributeValue` has no map alternative.

### `support/` — 4 headers, included as `conformance/support/<name>.hpp`

| Header | What |
|---|---|
| [`conformance_env.hpp`](support/conformance_env.hpp) | `GetEnv`, `UniqueMarker` (a per-run needle), and `ConformanceEnabled`, which implements the skip-or-fail contract below. |
| [`collector_output.hpp`](support/collector_output.hpp) | Reads back what the collector wrote: `PollForLineContaining`, `CountOccurrences`, and `EnclosingObject`, which narrows a line to one record (or its scope, or its resource). |
| [`provider_builder.hpp`](support/provider_builder.hpp) | `ConfigureConformanceBuilder`: endpoint, protocol, and timeouts short enough to fail fast instead of turning into a ctest timeout. |
| [`log_conformance.hpp`](support/log_conformance.hpp) | The logs scenarios and their expected protojson fragments, shared by both protocols. |

### `collector/config.yaml`

Four named `otlp` receivers, each on its own port pair, so a test picks
a transport-security posture by picking an endpoint rather than by
restarting the collector. All four feed one traces pipeline (the
`batch` processor, then the `file` exporter) and one logs pipeline (the
same `batch` processor, then a second `file/logs` exporter), so every
test asserts against one output file per signal whichever port it used.
Keeping the files apart means a trace assertion can never be satisfied
by a log line, or the reverse.

| Receiver | gRPC | HTTP | Posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| `otlp/plain` | 4317 | 4318 | no TLS |
| `otlp/tls` | 4327 | 4328 | server cert |
| `otlp/mtls` | 4337 | 4338 | server cert + client CA |
| `otlp/auth` | 4347 | 4348 | `bearertokenauth` extension |

Also exposed: the `health_check` extension on 13133 (the runner's
readiness signal) and Prometheus telemetry on 8888 (dumped as a
diagnostic when the gate fails).

**The auth receiver is asymmetric on purpose.** Its gRPC port (4347) is
plaintext, which is the original intent: no TLS means an auth failure
cannot possibly be a trust failure. Its HTTP port (4348) carries the
same server certificate as `otlp/tls`, because microtel cannot reach a
plaintext collector HTTP receiver at all: microtel is HTTP/2-only and
that receiver is HTTP/1.1-only (issue #166,
[`docs/interop-matrix.md`](../../docs/interop-matrix.md) §4). The HTTP
auth tests buy the isolation back by pinning the correct CA in every
test, so the negative test differs from the positive ones in exactly
one field: the token.

The same gap is why every OTLP/HTTP test here except
`plaintext_gap_test.cpp` points at a TLS endpoint. Those endpoints were
not chosen to test TLS; TLS is where ALPN negotiates `h2`, which is the
only OTLP/HTTP path that reaches a stock collector today.

## Running it locally

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DMICROTEL_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build
ci/scripts/conformance.sh build
```

The build-dir argument defaults to `build`. The script generates a
throwaway ECDSA CA, server, client and wrong-CA certificate set under
`<build-dir>/conformance/certs`, starts the pinned collector with
`<build-dir>/conformance/out` bind-mounted, waits up to 60 s on the
health endpoint, and then runs `ctest -L conformance`.

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | every conformance test passed |
| 1 | at least one conformance test failed |
| 2 | the gate could not run — no container engine, collector never healthy, or no test carries the `conformance` label |

Engine selection: `podman` if present, else `docker`. Two overrides:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `MICROTEL_CONTAINER_ENGINE` | force `podman` or `docker` |
| `MICROTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE` | override the pinned collector image |

On a failing run the script dumps the collector's logs and its
Prometheus metrics to stderr before removing the container.

**Plain `ctest` skips this tier, by design.** The binaries are
registered like any other test, so `ctest --test-dir build` runs them,
and every test skips because none of the environment variables below
is set. That is what keeps a developer box, and the `compile`,
`sanitizers` and `coverage` CI jobs, green without a collector.

## Environment contract

Exported by [`ci/scripts/conformance.sh`](../../ci/scripts/conformance.sh),
consumed through [`support/conformance_env.hpp`](support/conformance_env.hpp).

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_REQUIRE` | set once the collector is healthy; turns a missing variable from a skip into a failure |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_HTTP_ENDPOINT` | `http://127.0.0.1:4318`, plaintext, used only by the negative test |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_GRPC_ENDPOINT` | `http://127.0.0.1:4317`, plaintext, the gRPC default |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_HTTP_TLS_ENDPOINT` | `https://localhost:4328` |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_GRPC_TLS_ENDPOINT` | `https://localhost:4327` |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_HTTP_MTLS_ENDPOINT` | `https://localhost:4338` |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_GRPC_MTLS_ENDPOINT` | `https://localhost:4337` |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_HTTP_AUTH_ENDPOINT` | `https://localhost:4348` (`https`, because of the asymmetry above) |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_GRPC_AUTH_ENDPOINT` | `http://127.0.0.1:4347` |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_CA` | the run's CA, for `TlsOptions::ca_bundle` |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_WRONG_CA` | an unrelated CA, the negative control for CA pinning |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_CLIENT_CERT` | client certificate for the mTLS receivers |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_CLIENT_KEY` | matching client key |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_AUTH_TOKEN` | the bearer token `bearertokenauth` accepts |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_OUTPUT_FILE` | `<build-dir>/conformance/out/traces.jsonl` |
| `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_LOGS_OUTPUT_FILE` | `<build-dir>/conformance/out/logs.jsonl` |

### Why an all-skip run cannot masquerade as green

`ConformanceEnabled(env_name, out_value)` resolves one variable or
explains why the test cannot run:

```cpp
std::string endpoint;
if (!ConformanceEnabled(kHttpEndpointEnv, endpoint))
{
    GTEST_SKIP() << "collector not configured";
}
```

Outside the gate it returns false and the test skips. Inside the gate
`MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_REQUIRE` is set, so a missing variable records an
`ADD_FAILURE()` first, so broken plumbing in the runner fails loudly
instead of silently skipping everything. The runner's second guard is
independent: before exporting anything it counts
`ctest -N -L conformance` and exits 2 if the answer is zero, so a
build that registered no conformance tests cannot report success
either.

## Readback strategy

The collector runs the `file` exporter, which appends one compact
protojson object per batch: `ResourceSpans` to `/out/traces.jsonl`,
`ResourceLogs` to `/out/logs.jsonl`. Those files are the only place a
test can observe what the collector *understood*, as opposed to what
microtel claims it sent.

- Positive assertions poll that file for a line containing the run's
  `UniqueMarker()`, and then assert substrings of that line. Polling is
  needed because delivery is asynchronous: `ForceFlush` returning only
  means microtel handed the batch over. The expected fragments are the pinned
  image's protojson rendering: hex ids, camelCase keys, typed value
  envelopes, int64 as a quoted string. Every one was read off a real
  run against the pinned image rather than derived from the proto
  definitions, which is also why a pin bump is a procedure and not a
  version edit. See
  [`docs/interop-matrix.md`](../../docs/interop-matrix.md) §2 for the
  pin and §5 for how to move it.
- Exactly-once assertions use `CountOccurrences` instead of a presence
  check, so a retry the collector accepted twice fails instead of
  passing quietly.
- Log assertions are narrowed to one record. The collector's `batch`
  processor may merge several exports into one line, so "the line
  contains a `traceId`" would not prove *this* record has one — and the
  correlation test has to prove one record lacks what its neighbour in
  the same line has. Every log record carries a per-run unique
  `eventName`, and `EnclosingObject` cuts the line down to that record's
  JSON object (or its `ScopeLogs`, or its `ResourceLogs`) before any
  fragment is checked.
- Negative assertions read `Provider::GetExporterHealth()`
  (`connection_state`, `batches_failed`, `last_error_message`) and then
  assert the marker never appears in the output file at all.

The two suites share one set of fragment constants because encoding is
protocol-independent, and that was measured rather than assumed: the
collector's output line for the OTLP/HTTP basic-export span and the one
for its OTLP/gRPC twin are byte-identical once ids, timestamps and the
per-run marker are normalised
([`docs/interop-matrix.md`](../../docs/interop-matrix.md) §3).

## Deliberately excluded

| Not here | Where instead | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Partial-success responses | [`tests/unit/wire/otlp_response_test.cpp`](../unit/wire/otlp_response_test.cpp) and the two codec tests, against hand-encoded byte fixtures | A collector configured to accept spans never returns a `partial_success` body, so this tier cannot elicit one. |
| Retry and backoff timing | [`tests/unit/exporter/retry_policy_test.cpp`](../unit/exporter/retry_policy_test.cpp), [`tests/integration/sdk/exporter_health_test.cpp`](../integration/sdk/exporter_health_test.cpp) against fakes | Needs a clock the test controls. Here the negative tests run a near-zero retry budget precisely to *avoid* the schedule. |
| Restart recovery (collector bounced mid-export) | deferred; see [`docs/interop-matrix.md`](../../docs/interop-matrix.md) §6 | |
| Metrics conformance | deferred to v1.3; see [`docs/interop-matrix.md`](../../docs/interop-matrix.md) §6 | |
| Throughput and delivery rate at volume | the weekly [`interop.yml`](../../.github/workflows/interop.yml) workflow | Slow, and not a merge gate. |

## Known-defect tripwires

Five defects were found by building this tier. None of them is asserted
as desired behaviour. One is still open and pinned by a test that fails
when the defect is fixed; the other four are fixed, and the test that
guarded each one was turned into a regression test instead of being
deleted.

When the pinned test for #166 starts failing, don't delete it. Invert
it.

| Issue | What guards it |
|---|---|
| #166 (open): plaintext OTLP/HTTP unreachable (h2c vs an HTTP/1.1-only receiver) | `http/plaintext_gap_test.cpp` → `PlaintextHttpUnreachable` asserts `Connect()` to `:4318` **fails**. Invert it into a positive delivery test against `MICROTEL_CONFORMANCE_HTTP_ENDPOINT` when either side gains the missing half. |
| #167 (fixed): `InstrumentationScope` carried the service name instead of the `GetTracer(name, version)` scope | `{http,grpc}/basic_export_test.cpp` assert the scope name and version on the wire (`kScopeJson`). Until the fix (ICP 0023), this tier deliberately asserted nothing about `ScopeSpans.scope`, so as not to enshrine the bug. |
| #168 (fixed): `TraceId::ToHex()` / `SpanId::ToHex()` declared in a public header but defined nowhere | `src/api/` (`microtel_api`) now defines both, and `{http,grpc}/basic_export_test.cpp` call the public formatter directly. This tier builds against public headers only, so it is what hit the link error, and it is now what proves the encoding matches the collector's. |
| #169 (fixed): 22 of 24 `drop_counters` never written | `WrongTokenIncrementsNonRetryableDropCounter` in both `http/auth_test.cpp` and `grpc/auth_test.cpp`. It ran as a `DISABLED_` test until the counters were wired, and was kept separate from `WrongTokenRejected` so an accounting regression is distinguishable from a classification one. |
| #171 (fixed): `grpc-status` and `grpc-message` discarded; `last_error_message` was a fixed literal | `grpc/auth_test.cpp` asserts both halves separately: `last_error_message` names the status (`"UNAUTHENTICATED (16)"`, matching what its HTTP sibling does with `"401"`) and carries a fragment of the collector's own `grpc-message`. |
