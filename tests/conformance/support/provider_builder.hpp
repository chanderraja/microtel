// One place to configure a Provider aimed at the conformance collector.
//
// The defaults in TimeoutOptions and BatchOptions are tuned for a production
// process: a 5 s schedule delay and 10 s timeouts. In a test that is dead wall
// clock on every run and, worse, turns a genuine hang into a ctest timeout
// with no diagnostic. Everything here is short enough to fail fast and long
// enough that a loaded CI runner does not trip it.

///
/// Takes the builder by reference rather than returning a fresh one: the
/// public `SdkBuilder(SdkBuilder&&)` is defaulted in the header over a
/// `unique_ptr` to an incomplete pimpl, so instantiating it outside
/// src/sdk/sdk_builder.cpp does not compile. A by-value factory is therefore
/// not expressible; the caller owns the object and this configures it.
///
/// Service identity and transport security stay with the caller — chain
/// `WithServiceName`, `WithTls`, `WithHeaders` and so on before `Build()`.
///
/// @param builder  the builder to configure; borrowed for the call only.
/// @param endpoint OTLP endpoint URL, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:4318`.
/// @param proto    wire protocol to exercise.
/// @return @p builder, for chaining.
