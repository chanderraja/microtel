// Proves TimeoutOptions::retry_budget actually reaches the exporter's retry
// engine through a real SdkBuilder::Build() (issue #179).
//
// BuildExporters used to fill OtlpExporterConfig::export_deadline and leave
// retry_policy default-constructed, so every builder-built provider retried on
// RetryPolicyConfig's 5-minute in-class default no matter what the operator
// configured. A batch to a dead endpoint then sat in the backoff schedule for
// the better part of ten seconds before giving up. The knob was parsed,
// validated and documented, and then discarded.
//
// The existing retry tests in tests/unit/exporter/otlp_exporter_test.cpp
// construct OtlpExporterConfig by hand, so they exercise the budget mechanics
// while being blind to the wiring. Only a test that goes through the builder
// can see this.
//
// Integration tier: this opens a real socket and is wall-clock-bounded, which
// the unit tier's <1ms / no-I/O bar excludes.

// Generous by design: this separates two behaviours that are ~4x apart, and is
// not a measurement of either. Locally (clang, Debug), with the budget:
//
//   * ignored (the bug): 6.2 - 6.7s, the 5-attempt backoff schedule running to
//     exhaustion under RetryPolicyConfig's 5-minute default. Issue #179
//     independently measured 7.4s.
//   * honoured (fixed): 1.4 - 1.7s, of which none is backoff — the budget is
//     already spent when the loop takes its first budget check. That residual
//     is fixed export-path cost (lazy connect, per-export deadline, flush and
//     teardown); exporter_health_test pays the same ~1.5s.
//
// Confirmed by sweeping the budget in this harness: 1ms and 200ms both land at
// ~1.5s (zero sleeps), while 2000ms rises to ~3.1 - 3.9s as one backoff sleep
// fits inside it. So the assertion below is sensitive to the plumbing, not to
// machine speed.
//
// 5s leaves ~3x headroom above the slowest green run and ~1.2s below the
// *fastest* red one, which is the margin that matters for a false pass.
// Sanitizers barely move either — both paths are dominated by sleeps and
// socket timeouts rather than CPU (tsan 1.3 - 1.5s, asan 1.6s).
